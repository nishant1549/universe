The first HTML file is called star.html which is an animation of a star revolving around a spinning black hole, and that star has a planet revolving around it, and that planet has a moon revolving around it. To see the animation for star.html, you can open star.html in a browser (such as chrome) or you could open it using a local server (such as the live server extension used in VS code). The second HTML file is called starSystem.html which is an animation of a star system where there are 3 black holes and 3 stars and 3 planets and 1 moon (so a total of 10 objects). To see the animation for starSystem.html, you can open starSystem.html in a browser (such as chrome) or you could open it using a local server (such as the live server extension used in VS code).

All of the black holes in the animation are spinning/rotating black holes. One of the black holes has a star orbiting around it, and that star has a planet orbiting around it, and that planet has a moon rotating around it, so this is a 4 level hierarchical model where the black hole is at the 1st level (root level) of hierarchy, the star orbiting it is at the 2nd level of hierarchy, the planet orbiting that star is at the 3rd level of hierarchy and the moon orbiting that planet is at the 4th level of hierarchy. There are also 2 other rotating black holes with one having another small planet orbiting around it and the other black hole having a small star orbiting around it. This occurs in the universe as a black hole has such a powerful gravity that large objects such as stars and planets can have stable orbits around it if the black hole is a spinning one. Finally, there is also another star which is present in the system independently and has a planet orbiting around it. In the universe, systems like this exists where you can have multiple stars, black holes and planets forming a system/group. I created this project using the WebGL API, JavaScript and HTML. To create the 3D graphics for the project, I also used the three.js public javascript file (3D library) available at the following URL: https://threejs.org/build/three.js  

For more information, you can contact me about this.

Since I have loaded images from the internet for the textures in this project, I checked my output several times when loading the animation in star.html and starSystem.html to make sure all of the images were loading properly for the textures in the animation. However, although this is unlikely to happen since it didn't happen on my laptop, if in case if the images for the textures fail to load due to chrome CORS policy, try running  the project on a local server so that the output of the project can be viewed properly (the same way that I can view it). Otherwise you can contact me about this.
